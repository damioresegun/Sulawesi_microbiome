##### Author: Damilola R Oresegun
This is a developing script to carry out microbiome analysis for the Sulawesi Macaque fecal metagenome project. 
The faecal sample were extracted from healthy wild macaques and sequenced using the Oxford Nnaopore MinION. After this
the reads were put through a pipeline developed by the author to carry out assembly of the metagenomic sequences using
metaFlye. Following this, the assembled contigs were binned with
